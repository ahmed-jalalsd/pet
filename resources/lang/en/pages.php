                        (an authority in matters of taste). He lived during a challenging
                        time given that he was at the court of the erratic emperor
                        who ended up burning the Eternal City on a whim.

                        Latinist, was so enamored by this charismatic figure that
                        he decided to use his name for the company’s logo.This curious
                        and fascinating individual from classical antiquity thus
